# Virtual-CV

This is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase who I am, what I’ve studied, and the skills and projects I’ve worked on as a final-year IT student.

I built this using basic HTML and CSS to keep it simple, clear, and easy to navigate. It includes sections about me, my technical and soft skills, the coursework I’ve completed, group projects I’ve contributed to, and ways to get in touch with me.

## Why I made this

I wanted a space that represents me professionally, especially as I apply for opportunities in software development, data, cybersecurity, and AI. It’s a way to tell my story, show my progress, and make it easy for others to learn more about me.
